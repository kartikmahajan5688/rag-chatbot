Python is a high-level programming language used for web development, data science, automation, and artificial intelligence.
It has a large standard library and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented and functional programming.

Some of the most popular Python frameworks include Django, Flask, and FastAPI for backend development.
For data analysis, libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are widely used.

In AI and machine learning, Python is dominant because of frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
It also integrates easily with APIs and external services, making it ideal for building AI applications.
